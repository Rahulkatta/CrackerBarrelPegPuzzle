# CrackerBarrelPegPuzzle

Question:

Write a Java program equivalent to my Python program at:
https://github.com/ptarau/CrackerBarrelPegPuzzle
that implements a solver for the Cracker Barrel Peg Puzzle at:
https://shop.crackerbarrel.com/toys-games/games/travel-games/peg-game/606154
This time you will need to use classes and objects for things like the moves, the board you display them on and the solver itself.
Post your answer on github.com and provide a link to it in canvas. Feel free to clone my Python repository and work with it as a starting point.
